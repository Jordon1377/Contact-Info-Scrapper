This project we developed from August to Present. It was an idea inspired by the public database of plane registration. 
The goal of this project was to take registration data and find private plane onwer contact info based on said data. 
I ended up using opencoorperates API to parse company names with location into a best fit first and last name
I then used fastpeople searches database to scrape all contact info for name, location individuals. The data is not always accurate but entering the name and location of someone over the age of 30 yields surprisingly correct information!
I am currently running the program to parse the data so it has yet to be listed in the csv files!
